Taimadou Gakuen 35 Shiken Shoutai

The Sanctuary has spread out swallowing almost the entire world.
The United States, Russia, China, and other countries has a significant amount of pollution spread upon them, and there weren't many habitable areas left for humans
There were Inquisition headquarters in areas other than old Japan's land, but moving between the areas was limited to movement through the sky, and since its necessary to fly at an altitude of twenty thousand meters to be unaffected by the widespread Sanctuary, visiting other regions was difficult.
It was also difficult to call support from other areas because of the Sanctuary's interference which made it impossible to connect with them. On the other hand, the witches who survived by constructing a protective barrier have developed transfer magic and were doing that rather frequently.
